Welcome to yet another "tech blog". I'm starting this site for two reasons: 

* To have a proper web presence where colleagues, employers, clients and 
  who-ever might be interested can find information about my "professional"
  life.
* To have a place where I can share and discuss anything I've learnt that 
  I think may be worth something to others too.

I'll probably talk about my experiences writing apps and managing a
software development team. 

If you're looking for my adventures coming to Australia, you can 
still find them [here](http://xplizit.com/tom).

Thanks for stopping by!
