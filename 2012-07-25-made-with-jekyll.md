title: Made with Jekyll and Foundation

A few words on what this site is made of. It's based on some great work by the
open source community:

* It's a static site, made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), 
  which means I'm writing this in 
  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Why Jekyll? 
  I had a look at Python tools like [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) and 
  [Blogofile](http://www.blogfile.com) as well, but thought this was as good
  an excuse as any to start having a play with Ruby.
* I'm using [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) a, SASS/Compass 
  based responsive front-end framework to make it all look decent. Why 
  Foundation? I didn't want this to look like yet another Bootstrap site,
  and this was as good an excuse as any to have a look at SASS :)
  Plus, Foundation comes with some nice little Javascript features like 
  JQuery Orbit (slideshow) and Reveal (modal panel), which came in handy
  on the [projects](/projects/) page.
* Writing and maintaining a CV isn't the most interesting task, so I had
  had a look around to see if there's anything out there that can make this
  a bit more fun. I thought of using LaTex, but wanted to keep it simple. I
  came across [this project on Github](https://github.com/icco/Resume) that 
  allows you to write your CV in Markdown and easily host it on Github-pages
  or Heroku. I liked 
  [another project](https://github.com/maxim/maxim.github.com) that had a nice
  summary button. I decided I would take a bit of both and would be able to use
  [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) and/or
  [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to generate .doc, pdf and 
  even LaTex documents if needed.
* Oh, last but not least, this site is hosted on Rackspace and for now deployed
  using the magic of scp..

Still to do: dot a few i's here and there and share on Github like most of
the projects mentioned above!
