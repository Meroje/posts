A few months ago, the organisation I work for migrated email from a 
combination of on-side hosted MS Exchange and Linux based mail servers to
Microsoft's new cloud based offering: 
[Office 365](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/online-software.aspx). 

Not entirely to my surprise, I Immediately I found myself in some trouble. 
I use Ubuntu on my desktop with Mozilla Thunderbird as the email client. 
Although Outlook 365 does have IMAP support, it didn't play as nicely with 
Thunderbird as I would like.

I tried using MS Outlook in a Windows virtual machine for a while but that 
had it's own drawbacks (e.g. links would be opened in the Windows browser 
instead of on my host OS).

Thankfully, the Outlook 365 web-based email client isn't too bad.

Problem solved? Well, no.. the web app doesn't work on my favorite browser, 
Chromium for Linux.

So, I wrote a little Chrome extension that fixes the issue (by pretending
to be another browser) and threw in desktop notifications as well. 

After having used it for a while and some beta-testing by a colleague I 
[published it on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhfemhokeipigjjdopkanibcilnbbjpf).

So far so good, it's been in the store for a few days now and already has
50 users. Great to see this is useful to folks out there! :-)
